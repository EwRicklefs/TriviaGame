# TriviaGame

Basic trivia game.

Has initial intro page

Sets a timer when the quiz is started, counts down 60s (there is a separate visual timer as well, this does not work with the reset, I believe this is like the timer issue example we had where its pointing to another timer on the same variable, i more wanted to test reshowing elements like the start screen so I'm not going to troubleshoot)

On submission or after time is up, shows a results page with total of correct answers, incorrect answers, and %.

Results page has a reset button which takes user to main page.
